"Integration of a novel area detector into beamline control and data acquisition system"

Abstract: The use of novel, prototype x-ray detectors opens possibilities to expand beamline capabilities and perform measurements that were not previously possible. However, lab-developed prototype detectors often lack standard drivers and software for interfacing to beamline control and data acquisition systems, requiring the development of custom scripts and protocols that are time-consuming to construct and can hamper the overall experimental workflow. The mixed-mode pixel array detector (MM-PAD), developed at Cornell University, is a wide-dynamic-range area detector capable of framing continuously at 1 kHz. A 256 x 384 pixel version with a CdTe sensor has recently been added to the detector pool at CHESS and has been used to perform time-resolved in-situ diffraction studies of additive manufacturing at FAST. This project will focus on building a robust software interface between the MM-PAD and the beamline control and data acquisition system.
