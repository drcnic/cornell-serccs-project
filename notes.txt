QUESTIONS:
	3A FAST essentials
		BTR = ?
		Aux files directory, organized by what I'm assuming is an identifier for each run: what sort of metadata/files?
	Spec documentation
		Any commands I should never EVER touch?
		Progress on getting access to virtual spec instance?
		

NOTES:
	example_user_macro
		line 150: missing closing brace?
	mm_pad	
		what is a Keithley?
		Workflow? Which functions need to be executed prior to mm_pad data collection? Is it assumed they will be before executing user script, or must it be automated as well?
